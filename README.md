# What is this?

I worked through this great Python book which focuses on command-line interfaces in Python
and testing using pytest. This was a great brush up on fundamentals and was great to see how professionals work through some Python problems.
It also focuses on beginning to intermediate topics in Python like comprehensions, string manipulation,
regex', type hinting, and representing game state as a namedtuple. There is roughly one file that is edited by me in each numbered directory. This is my work
and effort that was guided by this book. Look for the much more recent modified date and me as an author within this 
github repository.
Everything you read below is part of the original author's readme.
